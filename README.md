## LEARNING BASICS 

## 1. What are Version Control Systems (VCS)?

A VCS is a tool that tracks changes to your files (like code or documents) over time. It lets you:

### Key Benefits:
- **Save versions** of your work (like "save points" in a game)
- **Revert** to older versions if you make a mistake
- **Collaborate** with others on the same project without conflicts

### Popular Example:
Git (the tool behind GitHub) is the most widely used VCS.

## 2. What is Git and why should you use it?

Git is a free, open-source version control system (VCS) that helps you:

### Key Features:
- **Track changes** in your code/files over time (like a "time machine")
- **Collaborate** with others without overwriting each other's work
- **Recover** old versions if something breaks

### Why Use Git?
âœ… **Undo Mistakes** - Accidentally deleted code? Git lets you restore it  
âœ… **Teamwork** - Multiple people can work simultaneously (using branches)  
âœ… **Organization** - Keeps history of who changed what and why  
âœ… **GitHub/GitLab** - Share code and contribute to open-source projects  
âœ… **Jobs Requirement** - Used by nearly all professional developers

## 3. How to Install Git Locally

### Windows
1. Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
2. Run the installer (.exe file)
3. Follow setup steps (keep default options)

Assuming you have created it or you can follow the below steps:
## Step-by-Step Guide

1. Go to [GitHub's signup page](https://github.com/signup)

2. Enter your details:
   â€¢ Email address (use one you can access)  
   â€¢ Password (create a strong one)  
   â€¢ Username (this will be your GitHub handle)  

3. Verify your account:
   â€¢ GitHub will send a verification code to your email  
   â€¢ Enter the code on the verification page  

4. Complete setup:
   â€¢ Choose your plan (Free plan is sufficient for beginners)  
   â€¢ Answer optional survey questions (or skip)  

5. Start using GitHub!

# Git & GitHub Basics

## Essential Git Commands

### 1. Initialize a Repository
```bash
git init
```
Creates a new Git repository in your current folder.

### 2. Stage Changes
```bash
git add .
```
Stages all changed files. Use `git add filename` for specific files.

### 3. Commit Changes
```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```
Saves your staged changes with a description.

### 4. Undo Changes
```bash
git reset HEAD filename
```
Unstages a file while keeping your changes.

### Branching
```bash
git branch new-feature     # Create branch
git checkout new-feature  # Switch branch
git merge new-feature     # Merge changes
```

## GitHub Integration
### Repository Setup
1. Create new repo on GitHub (public/private)
2. Connect local repo:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your/repo.git
git push -u origin main
```
3. Add links:
```bash
Go to [GitHub's signup page](https://github.com/signup)
```
  You can add normal link directly , and aslo use can use this type of line in README.md, the part under square brackets[] is your links specific name and under normal brackets() the normal link now this link will not show in the preview section.

### Daily Workflow
```bash
